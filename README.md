OpenAI has recently released new tools to facilitate the development of AI agents, which are designed to automate workflows, enhance decision-making, and perform complex tasks autonomously across various industries.

One notable tool is Operator, an AI agent that can use its own browser to perform tasks such as filling out forms, ordering groceries, and creating memes.
 Operator is currently available to Pro users in the U.S. and is powered by a new model called Computer-Using Agent (CUA).
 CUA combines GPT-4o's vision capabilities with advanced reasoning through reinforcement learning, enabling it to interact with graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and handle tasks on the web.

Additionally, OpenAI has launched the Responses API, which replaces the Assistants API and is set to sunset in the first half of 2026.
 This API allows businesses to develop custom AI agents that can perform web searches, scan through company files, and navigate websites.
 Developers can also use the Agents SDK, an open-source toolkit that offers tools to integrate models with internal systems, implement safeguards, and monitor AI agent activities for debugging and optimization.

These advancements aim to bridge the gap between AI agent demos and practical applications, potentially making 2025 the year AI agents enter the workforce
