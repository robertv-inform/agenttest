1. Handling Same Scores for Different Expertise
Issue:
Two candidates may get the same score due to similar words, despite different actual expertise.

Suggested Approach:

Use additional tiebreakers:
Years of Experience (most common approach)
Highest Education Level (Doctorate > Master’s > Bachelor’s)
Recency of Relevant Experience
The system currently calculates weighted similarity scores. Adding clearly defined tiebreaking criteria ensures consistent ranking.
2. Differentiating Closely Related Skills
Issue:
Embedding models might not distinguish well between skills like "Machine Learning" and "Deep Learning".

Suggested Approach:

Use more granular and domain-specific embedding models (e.g., fine-tuned models specifically for technical skill taxonomies).
Integrate skill ontology/taxonomy such as EMSI, O*NET, or a custom-developed one to explicitly differentiate skills beyond pure semantic similarity.
3. Ensuring Transparent Candidate Ranking
Issue:
Clearly explaining why one candidate ranks higher than another, and allowing recruiters to customize ranking criteria.

Suggested Approach:

Provide weighted contributions clearly in the UI. (Already implemented in your system.)
Allow recruiters to customize weightages easily through configuration. The current system stores weights in a config file, enabling straightforward customization and transparency.
A human-readable explanation is already generated by the LLM.
4. Managing Embedding Dimensions and Computational Cost
Issue:
High-dimensional embeddings are accurate but computationally expensive. Low-dimensional embeddings might lose semantic detail.

Suggested Approach:

Use embeddings in the range of 256–768 dimensions (industry-standard, manageable with Faiss indexing).
Apply dimensionality reduction methods like PCA, UMAP, or fine-tuning sentence transformers to balance accuracy and performance if needed.
Implement embedding caching (already partially implemented in your system) to enhance performance and manage computational cost effectively in microservice architecture.
5. Improving Embedding Model Accuracy on Job-Related Data
Issue:
General embeddings might not perform well for specialized industry/job-specific contexts.

Suggested Approach:

Fine-tune embeddings specifically on job descriptions, resumes, and job-specific data.
Regularly update and retrain embeddings using actual user feedback on matches.
Alternatively, incorporate a hybrid system where the embedding model is supplemented with domain-specific term matching or rule-based logic.
6. Handling Structured Attributes (Years of Experience, Certifications)
Issue:
Embedding models typically handle textual similarity well, but struggle with structured numeric or categorical attributes.

Suggested Approach:

Handle numeric attributes explicitly outside embeddings (already in place: total experience, degree requirements with explicit numeric checks in your system).
Use LLM or standardized libraries to extract structured data (years of experience, certifications, education levels).
Combine structured attribute scoring (years of experience, certification checks) explicitly with embedding-based text similarity scores to ensure accuracy.
7. Setting Appropriate Weights for Attributes
Issue:
Determining appropriate weights for different job attributes requires substantial domain expertise.

Suggested Approach:

Initially use reasonable defaults established from domain expert recommendations or market standards (already implemented in your JSON config).
Offer a UI or configuration module allowing domain experts or recruiters to adjust and fine-tune these weights based on the job type or preferences dynamically.
Collect feedback and continuously update default weights over time, potentially using an adaptive model.
8. Computational Cost of Text Normalization in a Microservice
Issue:
Text normalization (standardizing input text before embedding) might introduce computational overhead.

Suggested Approach:

Basic normalization (lowercasing, removing special characters, whitespace trimming) is computationally cheap and recommended.
More advanced normalization (stemming, lemmatization, spell correction) should be performed selectively or asynchronously to reduce microservice load.
Benchmark and test normalization overhead; currently, your candidate evaluation implementation can perform basic normalization without significant overhead.
If computational cost becomes noticeable, implement caching of normalized data.
